        <h1>Our mission</h1>
        <p>
          How might we support newly employed individuals in confidently understanding and selecting healthcare
          insurance plans, so they feel secure in their coverage?

          We focused on SDG Goal 3: Good Health and Well-Being, specifically with the hope of increasing access to
          “quality health services without facing financial hardship”.
          Through empowering individuals to navigate employer based healthcare options with clarity, we aim to reduce
          these barriers, build confidence, and promote equitable informed
          decision-making in accessing these health services.
